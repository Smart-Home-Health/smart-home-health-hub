# Backlog / Ideas

Stuff to pick up when there's time. No particular order.

---

## Live Dashboard

- **Per-modal re-auth (5 min)** — _IN TESTING_. Account password 1×/24h unchanged; opening any live-dashboard modal now requires a fresh user PIN (idle 5-min window), with the 3 large vital readings pinned visible during auth. Built via `PinChallengeContext` + `PinChallengeModal`. Spec: rolling idle, full user picker each re-auth.

---

## Frigate Integration

- **Live stream stability** — _FIX IN TESTING_. Live HLS failed most of the time while proxied MP4 clips worked. Two root causes, both now addressed:
  1. **Transport** — `live_url` pointed **directly at Frigate** (`http://<frigate>:5000/api/go2rtc/api/stream.m3u8`), so hls.js fetched it cross-origin (CORS + go2rtc cold-start → "works only when already warm"). Fix: backend **proxies + rewrites** the go2rtc HLS playlist same-site (`/live.m3u8` + `/live-seg`, SSRF-guarded + cold-start retry) in `backend/routes/frigate.py`; `CameraLiveModal.jsx` sends credentials via hls.js `xhrSetup`. _Confirmed working_ — segments now fetch/buffer.
  2. **Codec** — after the transport fix, hls.js threw `mediaError / bufferAppendError`, i.e. the source is a codec the browser's MSE can't decode (camera "Vent" is almost certainly H.265). Fix: the live upstream now requests `&video=h264&audio=aac` so go2rtc hands back H.264 (copies if already H.264; transcodes only if needed). Overridable via the `live_hls_codecs` setting.
  - **Still needs a device retest** against the real Frigate (`192.168.1.10:5000`, patient 5 / camera "Vent"). Diagnostic: `GET /api/integrations/frigate/patient/5/live-probe` reports go2rtc's detected codecs. If it still fails with H.265 reported, go2rtc likely lacks ffmpeg for transcode → enable a transcode in Frigate's `go2rtc` config. WebRTC mode still uses the direct URL.
- **VOD playback** — _RESOLVED (no action)_. Inline VOD already plays the **proxied saved MP4** (`/clips/file`, native `<video>`, same-site, range/seek), which works on Apple devices — the old direct-to-Frigate HLS-VOD path was the flaky one and has been **deleted** (`get_vod_hls_url`, `/clip`, `/clip-urls`). Known limitation left as-is per decision: H.265 MP4 won't play in non-Apple browsers (Chrome/Firefox/Android); closing that would need backend H.264 transcoding (adds ffmpeg to the image).

## Theming — Light / Dark / High-Contrast Mode

The entire UI uses hardcoded hex colors with no CSS custom properties. Adding theme support requires a prerequisite refactor before any theme can be switched at runtime.

### Phase 1 — Extract CSS variables (prerequisite for everything else)

**`AdminV2.css`** (~9,600 lines, GitHub dark palette — do this first, it's the active UI)

Identify and replace every raw hex with a variable. The palette is consistent so ~35–40 variables cover it all:

| Variable name | Current value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-bg-base` | `#0d1117` | Page background |
| `--color-bg-surface` | `#161b22` | Cards, sidebar, modal |
| `--color-bg-raised` | `#21262d` | Buttons, inputs, hover bg |
| `--color-bg-subtle` | `#30363d` | Borders, dividers, badge bg |
| `--color-border` | `#30363d` | All borders |
| `--color-border-muted` | `#21262d` | Subtle inner borders |
| `--color-border-emphasis` | `#484f58` | Hover border states |
| `--color-text-primary` | `#e6edf3` | Body text, headings |
| `--color-text-secondary` | `#c9d1d9` | Secondary text |
| `--color-text-muted` | `#8b949e` | Labels, placeholders |
| `--color-text-subtle` | `#6e7681` | Very muted text |
| `--color-accent-primary` | `#58a6ff` | Links, active nav, focus |
| `--color-accent-primary-dim` | `rgba(88,166,255,0.1–0.2)` | Tinted backgrounds |
| `--color-accent-purple` | `#a371f7` | Task/therapy badges |
| `--color-accent-purple-dim` | `rgba(163,113,247,0.2)` | |
| `--color-accent-orange` | `#f78166` | Medication icon |
| `--color-accent-orange-dim` | `rgba(247,129,102,0.2)` | |
| `--color-accent-yellow` | `#d29922` | Warning/equipment |
| `--color-accent-yellow-dim` | `rgba(210,153,34,0.1–0.2)` | |
| `--color-success` | `#3fb950` / `#238636` | Success states |
| `--color-success-dim` | `rgba(46,160,67,0.2)` | |
| `--color-success-emphasis` | `#2ea043` | Success hover |
| `--color-danger` | `#f85149` | Errors, delete |
| `--color-danger-dim` | `rgba(248,81,73,0.1–0.2)` | |
| `--color-danger-emphasis` | `#da3633` | Danger button bg |
| `--color-warning` | `#d29922` | Overdue/due |
| `--color-warning-dim` | `rgba(210,153,34,0.1)` | |
| `--color-info` | `#58a6ff` | Info notices |
| `--color-info-dim` | `rgba(56,139,253,0.1)` | |
| `--color-avatar-gradient` | `135deg, #58a6ff, #a371f7` | User/patient avatars |
| `--color-schedule-day-btn` | `#1f6feb` | Day selector active |
| `--color-overlay` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.7)` | Modal backdrop |
| `--color-shadow-card` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.3–0.4)` | Card/dropdown shadows |

Steps for AdminV2.css:
- [ ] Add a `:root` block at the top of AdminV2.css with all variables above
- [ ] Global find-and-replace each hex with its variable (use `replace_all` for each)
- [ ] Verify `rgba()` values that embed a hex — convert to `rgba(var(--color-*-rgb), 0.x)` or use a separate dim variable

**`App.css`** (~2,800 lines, legacy dashboard — second priority)

This uses a different palette (`#161e2e`, `#1a202c`, `#2d3748`, etc.) and is only used by the non-admin live dashboard. Extract separately:

- [ ] `--dash-bg` = `#161e2e`
- [ ] `--dash-surface` = `#1a202c`
- [ ] `--dash-raised` = `#2d3748`
- [ ] `--dash-border` = `#30363d`
- [ ] `--dash-text` = `#e2e8f0`
- [ ] `--dash-text-muted` = `#a0aec0`
- [ ] All the vital-specific colors (spo2 blue, bpm green, perfusion orange, bp red, temp yellow)

**Other CSS files** (smaller, lower priority):
- [ ] `LoginPage.css`, `LandingPage.css`, `LoginModal.css`, `FirstRunSetup.css`, `Layout.css` — scan for hardcoded colors and add to whichever `:root` block applies

---

### Phase 2 — Define light theme tokens

Add a `[data-theme="light"]` override block in `index.css` (applies globally). Map each variable to appropriate light values:

- Backgrounds invert: `--color-bg-base` → `#ffffff`, `--color-bg-surface` → `#f6f8fa`, `--color-bg-raised` → `#eaeef2`
- Text inverts: `--color-text-primary` → `#1f2328`, `--color-text-muted` → `#636c76`
- Borders lighten: `--color-border` → `#d0d7de`
- Accent/semantic colors stay close but may need lightness adjustment for contrast (test each)
- Status colors (danger, warning, success) likely need darker variants for light bg — check 4.5:1 WCAG AA

Key things to verify manually after:
- [ ] Nav active state is readable (blue on white)
- [ ] Badge/pill text has enough contrast
- [ ] Form inputs look intentional, not broken

---

### Phase 3 — Define high-contrast theme tokens

Add a `[data-theme="high-contrast"]` block. Requirements: WCAG AAA (7:1 ratio for text).

- Base: pure black `#000000` bg, pure white `#ffffff` text
- All borders become white or bright yellow (`#ffff00`)
- Accent/status colors become pure saturated: `#4dbbff` (info), `#ff6b6b` (danger), `#7ee787` (success), `#f9c846` (warning)
- Muted text eliminated — everything is either full white or a bright semantic color
- Shadows and translucent overlays removed (use solid borders instead)
- Focus rings: thick `3px` bright yellow outline on all interactive elements

---

### Phase 4 — Theme toggle in React

- [ ] Add theme state to a context or `localStorage` (key: `theme`, values: `dark` | `light` | `high-contrast`)
- [ ] On mount: read from `localStorage`, fall back to `prefers-color-scheme` media query (dark → `dark`, light → `light`)
- [ ] Apply `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme)` — this is what the CSS `[data-theme]` selectors key off
- [ ] Add a 3-way toggle button to the AdminV2 sidebar footer (sun / moon / contrast icons)
- [ ] Persist selection to `localStorage` on change

---

### Phase 5 — QA pass

- [ ] Walk every page of admin-v2 in all three themes: dashboard, patients, medications, schedule, care tasks, history, users, roles, settings
- [ ] Check all modal/overlay states
- [ ] Check all badge/status colors
- [ ] Check focus rings are visible in all themes (keyboard nav)
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport
- [ ] Verify legacy dashboard still looks correct in dark mode (it doesn't have a light variant — acceptable, or add a note in the toggle that it's dark-only)

---

## Medications

- **Zero-quantity administration guard** — _DONE (pending device test)_. Administering a dose larger than the on-hand `Medication.quantity` is now **hard-blocked** (no "administer anyway"). Backend returns `409 {error:"insufficient_quantity", ...}` from all paths (`/api/schedule/complete/medication`, `/complete/bulk`, and `administer_medication` → `/medications/{id}/administer`) via `backend/utils/medication_quantity.py`. Frontend `UpdateQuantityModal` (admin-v2 schedule) forces the caregiver to enter a new on-hand quantity (`PUT /api/medications/{id}`) and then retries the dose; bulk loops through multiple out-of-stock meds. The legacy **live dashboard** `MedicationModal` has the same gate on its Mark-Taken, PRN, and Mark-All paths (Mark-All stops at the out-of-stock med and is re-run after updating; completed doses are skipped to avoid duplicates).
- **Low-stock medication alert** — _approach undecided_. Need a way to know when a med is running low on hand (`Medication.quantity` in `backend/schemas/medication.py`), before it hits 0 and the [zero-quantity guard] blocks administration. Open questions to settle first: what defines "low" (a per-med reorder threshold field vs. a global "N doses left" / "X days left" computed from dose × schedule frequency)? and how to surface it (badge/count on the meds nav or dashboard, a dedicated alerts list, the existing monitoring/alerts system, or a push notification)? Likely starting point once decided: add a `low_stock_threshold` (or `reorder_at`) field to `Medication` + a computed "doses/days remaining", then surface it. Relates to the zero-quantity guard already built.
- **Grace-period doses** — missed doses should persist on the schedule view until administered or grace expires, so they don't get silently skipped. Full spec saved in Claude memory (`project-grace-period-doses`). Start point: Alembic migration + `grace_period_hours` field on `MedicationSchedule`.
